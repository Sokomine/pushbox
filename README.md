Experimental. Contains boxes that can be pushed around.

Nodes:
pushbox:glass Glass cover for the game field so that all positions of
              boxes and goals can be seen. Might later be made undiggable.

pushbox:box   Turns into pushbox:box_on_goal when pushed on a MESE block.
              Can only be pushed.

pushbox:small This one can also be pulled, not only pushed. Will not light
              up when on a MESE block.


The texture for the boxes is from the Darkage mod.
